#Formelo Form

A form is what you can build in Wufoo!

Fields are the building blocks you’ll use to collect data through a form. We provide field types for some of the most common data types (Address, Email, Website, etc.). Each form can include approximately 100 fields.

The upload limit for each plan is the total amount of data that your account can store. Forms themselves take up almost no storage, so we don't count those towards the storage limit. This limit is exclusively for files that are uploaded in File Upload fields on your forms.

##Rules & Logic

Rules and logic make your form smart and responsive. You can show and hide fields, skip pages, and show custom confirmation messages based on what people select or type when filling out your form.


##Notifications

Get notifications when someone submits your form or when a user in your Wufoo account adds a comment to an entry.

##Entries

An entry is a single submission of a form. When someone fills out one of your forms, and hits the Submit button, it will create an Entry containing the submitted information. Each plan includes a number of entries that you can collect each month.

##Reports

A report is a way to visualize data that’s been collect in a form. Reports are organized and displayed using widgets.

##Users & Permissions

A user (also called a sub-user) is another person who you’ve granted permission to access your Wufoo account. Users can be assigned permissions to view, create, and edit forms, reports, and themes in your account.
