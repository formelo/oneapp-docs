#Managing Users & Permissions

PAID FEATURE: Adding new users is only available on some paid plans—see if it’s on your plan.
Adding new users to a Wufoo account lets you work with a team to build forms, themes, and reports.

To get to the User Management page, log in and go to Users.

##User Roles

The type of information you can see or edit in an account depends on what your user role is. There are three types of users:

1. Account Creator: The person who created the Wufoo account and has access to everything in the account. If you're the Account Creator, it says Account Creator under your name on the User Management page.
2. Admin: People who have access to all forms, reports, and themes and can manage other users in the account. If you're an Admin, it says Admin under your name on the User Management page.
3. User: Users (with a capital U) only have access to some forms, themes and reports in the account, depending on their permissions. If you're a User, you'll only see yourself listed on the User Management page.
