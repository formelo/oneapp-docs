#Logging in to Your Account

The way you log in to your Wufoo account depends on if you’re the Account Creator or an Admin or User in an account. If you're not sure, follow the instructions under "I'm a user in an account".

##I created the account

If you created the Wufoo account, you can click Login from the Wufoo homepage, which takes you here:

```General Login Link: https://secure.wufoo.com/login/```

However, users you add to your account can't log in using that link—they have to log in using the Account Login Link, which has your account's subdomain in the URL in place of the word "secure":

```Account Login Link: https://subdomain.wufoo.com/login/```

##I'm a user in an account

If you're an Admin or a User in a Wufoo account, you need to log in using the Account Login Link.

To log in:

1. Go to the general login page.
2. In the address bar, edit the URL to replace the word "secure" with the account's subdomain: https://subdomain.wufoo.com/login/
3. Enter your email address and password.
4. How do I find the subdomain? You can see your subdomain whenever you're logged in to your Wufoo account—just look at the URL in the address bar of your browser. If you can't log in to see the subdomain, try to find the welcome email you got when you were first added to the account, which has the Account Login Link in it.

##Trouble Logging In

Please review the following troubleshooting info. If you're still not able to log in, feel free to contact us. It helps if you can send us a link to one of your forms and if you can confirm your subdomain.

To reset your password:

1. Go to the forgot password page.
2. In the address bar, edit the URL and replace the word "secure" with the account's subdomain: https://subdomain.wufoo.com/login/forgot/
3. Enter the email address you use for the account and click Submit.
4. Head over to your email inbox and follow the steps outlined in the email.

##I didn't get the password reset email
Check your spam or junk folder just to be sure! You can add no-reply@wufoo.com and apache@wufoo.com to your email whitelist to ensure the email isn't being blocked.

If you're still not finding the email, it's also possible you used another email address—try following the forgot password steps for other email addresses you might have used

##I'm entering the right info but I can't log in
If you know you're using the correct Account Login Link, email address, and password, and you're still having trouble logging in, clear your browser's cache and cookies. This often does the trick!

Additionally, your password expires one year after the last time you changed it—when it expires, we’ll require you to reset it the next time you log in.

##I forgot my email address
Try following the forgot password steps for any email addresses you might have used.
