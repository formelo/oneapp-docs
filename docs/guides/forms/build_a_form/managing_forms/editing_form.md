#Editing a Live Form

Once you share your form link with people, embed it on your website, and start getting entries, it becomes a little bit trickier to make certain changes to your form. Keep the following in mind:

##Editing the Title

Changing the Form Name will break any existing Title Links for your form that are already out in the world. If you anticipate needing to change your Form Name in the future, use the Permanent Link option instead.

##Deleting Fields

If you delete a field, any answers it's already collected will also be deleted. If instead you want to hide the field from people who take your form going forward, but still want to retain past entries, you can use CSS Keywords to hide the field.
