#Form Manager

The Form Manager is where you can view and manage all the forms in your account. To get there, click Forms in the header of your account. It's also the page you see when you first log in.

##Organizing Your Forms

###Sort
   
You can sort or reorder your forms based on the following criteria:
   
| Sort By        | Description           |   |
| ------------- |:-------------|: -----|
| Date Created     | Sorts forms by the date they were created, with the most recently created form at the top. | |
|Date Edited     | Sorts forms by the date they were last edited, with the most recently edited form at the top. | |
| Entries Today     | Brings all forms that received entries today to the top of the list. The rest of your forms are sorted in alphabetical order below them. |  |
| Name     | Sorts forms into alphabetical order, with special characters at the top followed by 0-9 and A-Z. |  |

###Search or Filter
Use the Search textbox at the top of the Form Manager page to narrow the list down to only forms that contain your search term in the title

###Folders
   
At this time there's no way to organize forms into folders.
