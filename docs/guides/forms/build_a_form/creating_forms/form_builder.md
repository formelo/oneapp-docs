##Field Settings

Field Settings are settings that you can apply to an individual field on your form—they control all sorts of things like validation, format, visibility, encryption, field size, layout and requirements for filling out the field correctly.

The Form Settings tab is where you can edit properties that apply to your entire form, set up confirmation options to customize what happens when people complete your form, and set limits and restrictions on form activity.
