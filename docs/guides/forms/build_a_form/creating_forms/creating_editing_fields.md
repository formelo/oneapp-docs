#Adding & Editing Fields

To add a field to a form:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to your form.
3. Click the Add a Field tab.
4. Decide which Field Type you need.
5. Once you decide which one you want, there are two ways to add it:
6. Click the field type to add it to the end of your form.
7. Drag and drop the field type anywhere on your form.
8. Click the field you just added to open its Field Settings and fiddle with the options there.
9. Click Save Form.

##Field Limit Per Form

You can add a maximum of approximately 100 fields to one form. We say "approximately" because some field types count as more than 1 field toward the limit. For example:

Checkboxes: Each answer choice counts as 1 field toward the limit.
Likert: Each row counts as 1 field toward the limit.
Address: Counts as 6 fields toward the limit.
If you hit the field limit, there's no way to extend it. However, you could consider this workaround to "stitch" two forms together: How to Seamlessly Stitch Large Wufoo Forms Together


##Managing Fields

###Delete a Field
To delete a field:

Log in and go to Forms.
Click Edit next to your form.
Click the field you want to delete to open its Field Settings.
In the left pane, click Delete.
