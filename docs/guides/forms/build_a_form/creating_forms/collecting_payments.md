#Collecting Payments Through Your Form
PAID FEATURE: Collecting payments is only available on some paid plans—see if it’s on your plan.
You can collect payments from people who fill out your form by integrating with one of our partnered merchants.

To collect payments through a form, or to access the Payment Settings page for an existing payment form:

1. From the Form Manager, click Payments next to the form you want to collect payments with.
2. In the Merchant Setup section, choose and authenticate the merchant you want to use to collect payments (for example, Stripe).
3. In the Payment Options section, choose the currency you want people to pay you with, and configure any of the optional settings.
4. In the Assign Prices section, set the prices for your form so Wufoo knows how much to charge the people that submit your form.
5. Select Enable Payment in the upper-right corner of the page.
6. Click Save Settings.

###Payment Options
Payment Options are the settings that control things like what fields appear on the payment page, who gets receipts, what info those receipts include, and more. Available payment options vary by merchant.

###Assign Prices
Assigning prices tells Wufoo what to charge the people who fill out your form. You can set a fixed amount that everyone needs to pay as the minimum fee, assign prices to individual fields on your form, or both.

For example, if you're building a registration form and everyone needs to pay the same minimum registration fee, you could set a Fixed Amount. If there are optional add-ons or special tickets that cost extra, you can also assign prices to individual fields on your form that people may select to sign up for those options.
