#Forms with Multiple Pages
By default, Wufoo forms have one page, but you can add Page Breaks to your form to introduce pagination and break up your form into smaller steps or sections.

###Adding a page Break

To add a Page Break:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to your form.
3. Click the Add a Field tab.
4. Drag and drop Page Break onto your form in the desired spot.
5. Click Save Form.
###Deleting a Page Break

When you delete a Page Break, we merge the page before and after the Page Break into one. The fields retain their data, and they stay in the same order.

To delete a Page Break:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to your form.
3. Click the page break you want to delete.
4. Click the red delete button that appears in the lower-right corner of the Page Break.
5. Click Save Form.

####Limits

1. Each page must contain at least one field.
2. There's no limit to the amount of pages you can add to a form, but each page break is considered to be a field and will contribute to the overall field limit.

Pagination Options

Once you add a page break to your form, there are a number of additional form elements and settings that become available. Click that page number bar that appears at the top of your form to edit the Pagination Options

| Option      | Description            
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
 | Steps     | Show circular page numbers at the top of your form. As a person fills out your form, the colors of the circles change to indicate their progress.
| Percentage | A progress bar will show at the top of your form that shows people the percentage they've completed so far.
| No Content | No progress bar will show at the top of your form
|Show Page Titles in Progress Bar|  Show or hide the page titles in the Steps or Percentage progress bar at the top of the page, and edit page titles.
|Hide Page Numbers in Footer	| Show or hide the page numbers from lower-right corner of your form—1/5, 2/5, 3/5, etc.

#####Navigation Buttons
When a form has multiple pages, we add Next Page and Previous buttons. See Navigation Buttons for more info on how to customize these extra buttons.

#####Partial Responses 
Multi-page forms also introduce the possibility of receiving partial entries—people might fill out and submit page 1, but abandon the form on page 2 without submitting their complete response.

We track what percentage of the form someone went through before abandoning the form, and we make this info visible in entries and reports.

1. In the Entry Manager we show the percentage of the form that the person completed before abandoning.
2. In the Report Builder you'll see two new columns:
 i. Last Page Accessed - Shows the last page the user tried to fill out before they left
ii.  Complete Submission - A yes or no indicating whether the person made it through the entire form.
