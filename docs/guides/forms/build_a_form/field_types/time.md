#Time Field

The Time field is a set of 3 textboxes (for hour, minutes, and seconds) with an AM/PM dropdown menu.


##Field Limits

Time fields are validated so that people must enter a real time. For example, if someone were to enter 36:10:54 AM, they'd get an error message that prompts them to enter a valid time.

##Field Settings

The Time field type supports the following Field Settings:

1. Require an Answer
2. No Duplicates
3. Admin Only Field
4. Instructions for User
5. CSS Layout Keywords â€” hide the Seconds textbox or AM/PM dropdown!

##Pre-Populate Current Time

There's no way to populate the current time into a Time field, but every entry is automatically recorded with a timestamp (date & time created), which you can view in the Entry Manager.

You can also insert that timestamp into confirmation messages, confirmation emails, and notifications using Templating.
