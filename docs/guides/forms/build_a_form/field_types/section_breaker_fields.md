#Adding Extra Text with Section Break Fields

Section Break fields let you add large amounts of text into your form. This field type doesn't collect any data, but it lets you add a heading and paragraph text anywhere in your form to provide more context or to break up your form in to sections.

Since HTML is supported, it's also really useful to use as a empty canvas for using HTML to add images, links, maps, and videos.

Section Break fields don't appear in reports.
