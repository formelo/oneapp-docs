Field Types

Fields are the building blocks of forms—they let you collect data from the people who fill out your form. There are lots of field types you can add to your form so you collect the right kind of data, in the right format.

##Standard Fields

Standard Fields usually don't have any built-in validation—they're simple, flexible fields that accept a wide range of inputs from people filling out your form

##Fancy Pants Fields

Fancy Pants Fields are already set up to accept specific types of data from people filling out your form. These fields are either formatted or validated to collect certain types of data, in a consistent format. In some cases, using the right Fancy Pants field also ensures that your data is presented in the most useful way in the Entry Manager.
