#Pre-Populating Fields

You can pre-populate many field types so that an answer is pre-selected, or has a predefined text or numerical value, when people go to your form. If someone submits your form without changing the pre-populated answers, the pre-populated answer will be included in their final entry.

If you want to add example text to your field that disappears when people start typing (and never gets recorded in your results), use the Placeholder Text field setting instead.

To pre-populate a field on your form:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. Click a field to open its Field Settings.
4. For Open-Ended Fields: In the Predefined Value textbox, type in the value you want to be pre-populated.
5. For Closed-Ended Fields: In the Choices section, select the radio button or checkbox you want to be preselected.
6. Click Save Form.
