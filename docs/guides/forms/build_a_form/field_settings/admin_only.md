#Admin-Only Fields

The Admin-Only field setting lets you hide a field from public view, so it's only editable through the Entry Manager by users in your Wufoo account with View and Edit permissions for that form. Admin-Only fields are useful when you want to associate, evaluations or scores with an entry.

When you export your data or create a report, Admin Only data will be included with the rest of the entry data. If you want to keep your notes separate, use the Comments field in the Entry Manager instead.

You can apply this setting to any field type.

To make a field Admin Only:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. In the Form Builder, click the field to open its Field Settings.
4. Under Options, select Admin Only.
5. Click Save Form.
