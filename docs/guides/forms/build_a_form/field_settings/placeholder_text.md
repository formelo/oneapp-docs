Placeholder Text

The Placeholder Text field setting adds grey example text to your field that disappears when people start typing, and isn't recorded in your results.

If you want to set a default answer that will be recorded in the entry if the person filling out your form doesn't change it, use the Predefined Value field setting instead. If you have both settings filled out, Predefined Value will show instead of Placeholder Text.

To add placeholder text to a field:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. Click a field to open the Field Settings.
4. In the Placeholder Text textbox, type in the text you want to show up in the field when it's empty.
5. Click Save Form.

You can change the color of the placeholder text in the Typography section of the the theme applied to your form.
