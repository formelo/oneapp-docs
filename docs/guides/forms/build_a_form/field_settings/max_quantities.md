#Setting Max Quantities Per Answer Choice

Use the Max Quantities field setting to limit how many times a specific answer choice can be selected. This is super useful for order and registration forms where you have a limited inventory or number of spots, and you want to protect people from submitting an entry for a choice that isn't available anymore.

To apply the Max Quantities setting to a field:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. In the Form Builder, click the field to open its Field Settings.
4. Under Options, select Max Quantities. In the Choices section, you'll see a Max Quantity field pop up underneath each choice.
5. Enter a quantity for each answer choice, or leave it blank to set an unlimited quantity for that answer choice.
6. Click Save Form.

##Show or Hide Remaining Quantities

By default, we show grey text to the right of each choice indicating the remaining quantity. When there's a quantity of 0 remaining for a choice, the choice will still be visible to people taking your form, but it will be disabled so no one can select it.

You can use custom CSS to hide the remaining quantities from people taking your form. Learn more: Using Custom CSS to Maximize Your Form's Max Quantities
