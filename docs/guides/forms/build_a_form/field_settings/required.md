#Required Field

When you make a field required, people must enter an answer to the field in order to submit their entry. When someone tries to submit an entry without filling out a required field, we highlight the problematic fields and display an error message to let them know the field is required.

You can apply this setting to any field type.

To require an answer to a field:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. In the Form Builder, click the field to open its Field Settings.
4. In the Options section, select Required.
5. Click Save Form.

Required fields are marked with a red asterisk next to the field label. There's no way to change the color of the asterisk.

##Dropdown Fields

The Required setting works a little differently for Dropdown fields. Learn more: Dropdown Field

##People Skipped Required Fields

If you notice in your entries that people were able to skip required fields, there are a few things that may be happening:

1. You may have rules applied to your form that are skipping people past these required fields (or hiding them).
2. If your form has multiple pages, the person may have exited your form early without completing every page.
