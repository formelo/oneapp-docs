#Adding Instructional Text to a Field

You can use the Instructions for User field setting to provide additional context or instructions for filling out a particular field in your form. When someone clicks into a field to fill it out, the instructions for that field will appear in a box to the right. They'll disappear when they move on to the next field, so you can provide necessary context for each field without cluttering your form.

You can apply this setting to any field type.

To add instructional text to a field:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. In the Form Builder, click the field to open its Field Settings.
4. Type your additional info into the Instructions for User textbox. HTML formatting is supported!
5. Click Save Form.

Instructions won't show up in the Form Builder, so you need to view your form to test them out.

You can control the appearance of the box via the theme applied to your form.
