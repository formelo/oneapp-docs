#Randomizing Answer Choices

The Randomize setting lets you display the answer choices for a Multiple Choice field in a random order for each person that takes your form.

You can only apply the Randomize setting to the Multiple Choice field typeâ€”not Checkboxes or Dropdown.

To randomize choices:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. Click Edit next to the form.
3. In the Form Builder, click the field to open its Field Settings.
4. Under Options, select Randomize.
5. Click Save Form.
