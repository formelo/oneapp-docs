#Managing Individual Entries

You can manage all the individual entries for your form from the Entry Manager.

To manage an individual entry:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. To the right of the form, click Entries.
3. Choose All entries.
4. At the bottom of the page, click on an entry in the datagrid to view and manage it.

Description

1. The title of the form.
2.	The entry data (the response to the form).
3.	Any attachments uploaded to the form, if there's a File Upload field in your form.
4.	The entry number. #1 is the first entry that was submitted. This number does not change if you edit or delete entries.
5.	The date and time the entry was created. On a single-page form, this is when the form was submitted. On a multi-page form, this is when the first page was submitted.
6.	The IP address of the person who filled out the form.
7.	The date and time the entry was updated and by whom in the Wufoo account. If the entry was never edited, you won't see this box.
8.	Create a new, blank entry that you can fill out and submit. Or edit, email, print, or delete the entry that you're viewing.
9.	On a multi-page form, you'll see whether all pages in the form were submitted or not. On a single-page form, you won't see a progress bar.
10.	Use these arrows to go back to the previous entry or to move forward to the next entry.
11.	Leave a comment about the entry. Comments can only be viewed in the Entry Managerâ€”they aren't included in exports.
