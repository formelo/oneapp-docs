#Downloading Entries & Reports

##Downloading, Printing, or Emailing a Single Entry

To download, print, or email a single entry:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. To the right of the form, click Entries.
3. Choose All entries.
4. At the bottom of the page, find the entry in the datagrid and select it.
5. In the upper-right corner of the entry, click the Print button or Email button. When choosing print options, you can choose to save the file as a PDF. When emailing, separate email addresses with a comma or semicolon.

Note: Comments aren't included in exports.

##Exporting Entries in Bulk

To download entries from the Entry Manager:

1. Log in and go to Forms.
2. To the right of the form, click Entries.
3. Choose All entries.
4. At the top of the datagrid, click BULK ACTIONS.
5. In the right of the datagrid, click Export.
6. Choose an export format: Excel (.xls), Tab Delimited (.txt), or Comma Delimited (.csv). The .xls spreadsheet works best for Microsoft Excel 2003 and later. If you have an earlier version of Excel, or use another spreadsheet software like Pages or Google Sheets, we recommend exporting the .csv format.
TIP! Instead of exporting all entries, you can filter the entries you want to export by using the search box at the top of the datagrid, then bulk exporting.

##Exporting Reports

To download report data:

##View the report.
In the upper-right corner of the report, click Export Data.
Choose an export format: Excel (.xls), Tab Delimited (.txt), or Comma Delimited (.csv). The .xls spreadsheet works best for Microsoft Excel 2003 and later because it's XML based. If you have an earlier version of Excel, or use another spreadsheet software like Pages or Google Sheets, we recommend exporting the .csv format.
TIP! To add the Export Data button on your report, go to your Report Settings. To control the data people can export, edit your datagrid widget settings by turning off (unchecking) the Allow User to View Columns Not Checked setting and uncheck any field that should not be seen or exported.

##Downloading File Uploads

To download a file upload, open an entry and click the link for the file.

When you export entries in bulk, file uploads aren't automatically downloadedâ€”but there are links to the files included in the spreadsheet so you can download them one by one.

##Exporting Data Using Integrations or API

You can export data from your Wufoo account into another site using one of our integrations. You can also use our API.
