#Building a Report

Reports allow you to visually display the data you collected through your form and share the results with others. In order to create a report, you must have an existing form.


##Building Reports

###Creating a Report

To create a report:

1. Log in and go to Reports.
2. Click + New Report.
3. Under Select Data, choose the form you want to use—the one you want to pull entry data from.
4. Add Widgets to your report.
5. At the bottom of the page, click Save Report as you make edits.
6. Go to Reports—click View to see the live report, or get the share link or embed code.

###Report Settings: Title, Description & Export Setting
Go to the Report Settings tab to edit the title and description of the report. You can also choose if you want to allow people to download (export) the report.

###Select Data: Choosing a Form & All Entries vs. Selected Entries
Go to the Select Data tab to choose the form you want the report to be based on.

Each report can only show data from one form—you can't merge data from multiple forms into one report. But you can create multiple reports for one form.

You can choose to use All Entries in your report or just use Selected Entries. Choosing Selected Entries allows you to filter the data you use by creating one or more conditions.

###Select Data: Creating Conditions to Filter Report Data

You can create a report based off only some of your entry data. For example, if you have a field in your report asking someone to choose the department they work in, you can create a report that only includes entries from that department.

To filter the data you want to use in your report:

1. Log in and go to Reports.
2. Under your existing report, click Edit.
3. Click the Select Data tab.
4. Choose selected entries from the first drop-down menu.
5. Choose if you want any or all conditions to be true. ANY is the same as the OR operator and ALL is the same as the AND operator.
6. Create your conditions. You can filter results by how people filled out the different fields in your form and by entry info. To add multiple conditions, click the green plus sign to the right of a condition.
7. At the bottom of the page, click Save Report.
